The examples are written using TypeScript. You don't have to use TypeScript for React DnD, it is completely optional. [The tutorial](/docs/tutorial) should give you a good idea about using React-DnD in JavaScript.

Check out the [hosted versions of this examples](http://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/examples-chessboard-tutorial-app.html). To run them locally, clone the repo, and run `yarn install && yarn start`. It will take a while to start, but after the site is built, you can access the examples by opening [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and clicking “Examples” in the navigation bar.
