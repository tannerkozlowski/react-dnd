This example demonstrates drop targets that can accept copy and move
drop effects, which users can switch between by holding down or
releasing the alt key as they drag.

In a todo list app, for example, the default drag and drop operation
could be used to sort the list, while holding down the alt key while
dragging and dropping could copy the todo item to the drop target
instead of moving it.
