This is the same simple example, but nested in an iframe.

When you are using the [react-dnd-html5-backend](/docs/backends/html5), you are limited to
drag-and-drop within a single HTML document.

Using react-dnd inside of an iframe requires using a [DragDropContextProvider](/docs/api/drag-drop-context-provider) within the iframe.
